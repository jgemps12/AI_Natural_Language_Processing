# Analyzing the Similarity of Essays with Natural Language Processing

## About this Project:
This project applies three different **Natural Language Processing algorithms** to determine the similarities of over 13,000 essays. Each algorithm assigns a **similarity score** to all possible essay pairs, then
selects the five most similar. Limitations, accuracy, and time complexities for each algorithm are then analyzed in an Overleaf report.

## Dataset:
This project uses the ***Learning Agency Lab - Automated Essay Scoring 2.0*** dataset from Kaggle. 

Due to Kaggle's licensing terms, the dataset is not included in this repository.
